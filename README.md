# Rocket Mouse

In the 2D side-scroller game Rocket Mouse, the mouse is equipped with a rocket, transforming it into a dynamic flying object. The objective is to collect coins scattered throughout the screen while avoiding various obstacles. To navigate, you control the rocket’s ascent and descent by pressing a designated button, guiding the mouse up and down to gather coins and steer clear of hazards. The challenge lies in balancing the rocket’s movement to maximize coin collection while avoiding collisions with obstacles.
